Resume Domain Detection
Project Overview
The Resume Domain Detection project aims to automatically analyze resumes and determine the domain or field of expertise for each resume. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information and classify the resumes into various domains such as technology, finance, healthcare, marketing, etc.

This README file provides an overview of the project, its components, and instructions on how to set it up and run it on your local machine.

Key Features
The main features of the Resume Domain Detection project include:

Resume Parsing: The system parses the resume documents, extracting key information such as name, contact details, work experience, education, and skills.

Text Classification: The extracted text from the resume is classified into specific domains using machine learning algorithms. The classification model has been trained on a diverse dataset containing labeled resumes from various domains.

Domain Labeling: Once the classification model identifies the domain, each resume is assigned a label indicating the specific field it belongs to. For example, a resume might be labeled as "Data Science", "Web Developer" and etc...

Accuracy Evaluation: The system provides an evaluation of the accuracy and performance of the domain detection model. This evaluation can be used to assess the effectiveness and reliability of the classification algorithm.
